Here's an idea of what I want to create for my capstone.
# Cardian
The final solo project.

# Why would I need this?
Keeping track of cards is one of the hardest parts about character card games, so I believe a databases creation app would make it easier to standardize card and prevent duplicate or similar descriptions.

# What inspired this app?
The concept of this app was inspired by my prior employer, who owns a physical card game and would like to give this as a present to my old boss. The biggest problem we had was keeping our cards organized so this tool might be useful for him.

# Features
Card effects will only be generated by dropdowns with presets but will also have to option to use custom text as a last resort or if there is nothing special about them. The card will be viewable in the viewport while editing.

There will be a cards model with
* backgroundImage src
* characterImageSrc
* rank
* title
* description
* category
* effects
* etc

# Technologies used
* React
* Flask
* SQLAlchemy
* Beautiful React Drag and Drop

## Bonus
* Create custom decks from created cards.
* Test the card against players with some rules I made it.
* Analytics: Save examine how often a card is used in a deck
Still going to plan more for this.
